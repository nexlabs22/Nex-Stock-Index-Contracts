## Overview

The Nex Stock Index Contracts provide:

- A decentralized framework for creating and managing stock indices.
- Real-time integration with data providers for accurate stock price tracking.
- Tokenized stock index solutions for seamless trading and liquidity.

## Features

- **On-Chain Data Integration**: Uses oracles to fetch real-time stock prices.
- **Custom Index Creation**: Design indices with customizable asset compositions.
- **Transparency**: Open and verifiable calculations and asset management.
- **Decentralized Trading**: Enable tokenized indices for trading on decentralized exchanges.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/): A development framework for Ethereum.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (optional, for auxiliary tools).
- Access to an Ethereum-compatible RPC node.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nexlabs22/Nex-Stock-Index-Contracts.git
   cd Nex-Stock-Index-Contracts
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   forge install
   ```
3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   forge build
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file and add the following variables:

   ```env
   RPC_URL=<Your RPC URL>
   PRIVATE_KEY=<Your Wallet Private Key>
   STOCK_ORACLE_API_KEY=<API Key for Stock Price Oracle>
   ```
2. Configure additional settings in the contract files if required.

## Usage

### Deploy Contracts

Deploy the contracts to your preferred Ethereum-compatible network:

```bash
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --broadcast
```

### Create a Stock Index

1. Use the deployment scripts or a frontend dApp to initialize a new stock index.
2. Specify the asset composition and weights for the index.

### Track Indices

Integrate with oracles to fetch real-time stock prices and update the index values on-chain.

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify the contracts:

```bash
forge test
```

Use the `-vvv` flag for verbose output:

```bash
forge test -vvv
```
